# llm-rag – Week 1 Training (Cubic Engineering Consultancy)

This repository contains my Week 1 training work at Cubic Engineering Consultancy. The focus of this week is:

- Python environment setup and tooling
- Git and GitHub workflow
- LLM fundamentals (tokens, context windows, embeddings, fine-tuning vs RAG)
- A simple "Hello LLM" Jupyter Notebook with token counting and cost estimation
